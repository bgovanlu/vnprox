# Needs hardware validation

Behaviors developed and tested only against `internal/pvemock` that a real Proxmox VE cluster must
confirm before v1.0 ships. Per CLAUDE.md, implementation agents have no live PVE access; this is
the accumulating checklist for the first hardware pass (owner: T-6xx hardening/validation work).
Check items off with the PVE version tested.

## PVE API behavior

- [ ] **API-token auth**: real PVE accepts `Authorization: PVEAPIToken=user@realm!tokenid=secret`
      as implemented in `internal/pve` (header shape, no cookie/CSRF), and **token privilege
      separation** (`privsep`) semantics — pvemock models tokens as carrying the owner's full
      privileges (`internal/pvemock`, TokenSpec).
- [ ] **Ticket-as-password renewal**: PVE accepts a still-valid ticket as the `password` on
      `POST /access/ticket` (the client drops the plaintext password after the first successful
      ticket renewal — `internal/pve/auth.go`); confirm the acceptance window near expiry and
      behavior on TFA-enabled realms.
- [ ] **`GET /access/permissions` response shape**: real per-path ACL tree with concrete privilege
      enumeration (pvemock reports a flat list at `/` and may carry a literal `"*"`);
      `BuildCapabilities` (`internal/auth/caps.go`) handles both, but the real shape should be
      captured as a fixture.
- [ ] **TFA/TOTP flow**: modern PVE returns a two-step NeedTFA ticket-challenge; the mock (and
      `POST /auth/login`'s `otp` passthrough) model the single-step `otp` param variant only.
- [ ] **IPAM wire shapes**: exact fields/types of `GET /cluster/sdn/ipams` and
      `…/{ipam}/status` (notably `gateway` as 0/1 int, `vmid` typing), and behavior with
      NetBox/phpIPAM plugins vs the built-in `pve` IPAM.
- [ ] **PUT request encoding**: the client sends JSON bodies; pvemock and modern PVE accept this,
      but confirm against the oldest supported PVE version.
- [ ] **Ticket expiry**: real tickets expire (~2h); confirm the renewal margin
      (`Config.TicketRenewAfter` default) beats it comfortably under clock skew.

## Host / OS behavior

- [ ] **`systemctl start vnprox` from the .deb** on a real PVE node (the container test script
      cannot run systemd as PID 1 — `packaging/test/deb-install.sh` documents the gap).
- [ ] **Real netlink/LLDP/bonding readers** on a PVE node with bonds, VLAN-aware bridges, and
      lldpd running (`internal/host` integration tests skip without privileges/peers;
      `TestReal_LLDP` and bond-detail tests have never run against real hardware).
- [ ] **PVE-cert reuse + hot-reload** against a real pveproxy certificate rotation.

## UI

- [ ] **60fps pan/zoom measurement on a GPU-composited dev machine**: the committed measurement
      (`docs/testing/topology-performance.md`) is from a headless software-rasterized VM
      (~35 fps, with an idle control proving the environment itself hits 60) — a pessimistic
      floor, not a pass/fail verdict. A console-paste rAF snippet is included in the doc.
      (The four-layer render itself IS regression-protected: `npm run e2e` runs a Playwright
      screenshot-baseline test with real login — see
      `docs/testing/topology-render-verification.md`.)
- [ ] **`host-interfaces` raw source in the inspector against a real node**: the captured detail
      fixture's `pve-network` raw source is live-captured, but the interfaces(5) stanza half was
      hand-extended per the pinned shape (`web/src/topology/__fixtures__/inventory-detail-vmbr0.json`,
      noted in its test header).
